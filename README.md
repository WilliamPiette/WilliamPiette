- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamPiette
- 👀 I’m interested in :               game design, back end, learning a bit of everything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning :          java,c++,jsp,html,css,mySQL and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on :   Anything to get me a job! But for fun? Modding seems like a good time.
- 📫 How to reach me :                 I'm mostly accessible through teams or whatever mail system my school uses.
                                         This is because its more isolated and thus more secure. Otherwise, I am active on discord and messenger.
- Yes I am using a template description from a school project 200 years in the past...totaly for efficiency! Still the info was wayyy out of date, I had to change it.
