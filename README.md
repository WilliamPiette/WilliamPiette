- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamPiette
- 👀 I’m interested in :               game design, back end, learning a bit of everything
- 🌱 I’m currently learning :          java and how to exist, always open to learn more
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on :   Unity/Vr related stuff (because this is an interest of mine, but its also because the options are a bigger jump from what I know)
- 📫 How to reach me :                 Being a student, I preffer Mio or Teams, moving to more comfortable platforms only once the team is set.
                                         This is because its more isolated and thus more secure. Otherwise, I am active on discord, messenger and gmail
